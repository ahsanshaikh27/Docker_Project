# Docker: Architecture and Terminology

## üì¶ Docker Architecture

The Docker architecture simplifies containerization by making it portable, scalable, and efficient. It includes several components that work together to build, ship, and run containers.

### üîß Components

- **Dockerfile**: Script used to build Docker images.
- **Image**: Read-only blueprint for a container.
- **Container**: Running instance of an image.
- **Docker Container Engine**:
  - `dockerd` (Docker daemon)
  - `containerd`
  - `runc`
- **Operating System Kernel**: Shared by all containers.
- **Docker Hub**: Remote registry to store and retrieve Docker images.
- **Host Machine**: Can be a physical or virtual system.

### üõ† Workflow

```text
1. docker pull      # Downloads the image from registry
2. docker run       # Starts the container from the image

üìò Docker Terminology

Here are the most essential Docker terms you should know:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Container

A lightweight, standalone, executable package containing all dependencies (code, runtime, system tools).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Image

A snapshot (read-only) used to create containers. Built from Dockerfile instructions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Dockerfile

A script with a set of instructions used to create a Docker image.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Registry

A repository to store Docker images.

Examples: Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, self-hosted registries.

Key Commands:

docker pull <image> ‚Äì Download an image

docker push <image> ‚Äì Upload an image



5Ô∏è‚É£ Repository

A collection of images with the same name but different tags.

Example: nginx:1.20, nginx:latest


6Ô∏è‚É£ Tag

A label used to identify versions of an image.

Example: python:3.10, nginx:latest


7Ô∏è‚É£ Network

Virtual network that allows containers to communicate.

Types:

bridge: Default

host: Shares host network

overlay: Multi-host networking


Command: docker network create <name>


8Ô∏è‚É£ Orchestration

Manages multiple containers for high availability and scalability.

Tools: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes


9Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Compose

Tool to define multi-container applications using docker-compose.yml.

Example:


version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

üîü Container Runtime

Underlying software that actually runs containers.

Examples: containerd, runc, CRI-O


11Ô∏è‚É£ Build Context

The directory Docker uses during docker build.

Command: docker build .


12Ô∏è‚É£ Layer

Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image.

Layers are cached to improve performance.


13Ô∏è‚É£ Port Binding

Maps a container port to the host.

Example: -p 8080:80


14Ô∏è‚É£ Docker CLI

Command-line interface to interact with Docker.

Common Commands:

docker ps ‚Äì List running containers

docker run ‚Äì Create and start container

docker stop ‚Äì Stop a running container

üèÅ Conclusion

Understanding Docker architecture and terminology is key to mastering containerization. Whether building a single app or orchestrating dozens of microservices, Docker provides the tools and concepts needed to succeed in any container-based workflow.
