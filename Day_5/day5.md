📘 Docker Commit & Docker Terminology

📦 Create Docker Image from a Running Container

The docker commit command is used to create a new Docker image from a container's changes. This is especially useful when you’ve made manual changes to a running container and want to preserve those changes as a new reusable image.

✅ Use Case

You’ve started a container, installed some packages, changed configurations, or added files manually — now you want to save the current state of the container as a new image.

🧭 Step-by-Step Guide

1. 🚀 Run a Container

docker run -it ubuntu bash

2. 📝 Make Changes Inside the Container

apt update
apt install -y nginx
exit

3. 🔍 List All Containers

docker ps -a

4. ⚖️ Commit the Container

docker commit <container_id_or_name> new_image_name:tag

Example:

docker commit 123abc45 ubuntu-nginx:latest

5. 📊 Verify the New Image

docker images

6. 🔁 Run a Container from the New Image

docker run -it ubuntu-nginx bash

🌍 Real-Life Example

docker run -it ubuntu bash
apt update
apt install -y curl
exit

docker ps -a
# Find container ID, say abc123

docker commit abc123 my-custom-ubuntu:1.0

docker images
docker run -it my-custom-ubuntu:1.0 bash

🖊️ Notes

Not a best practice: Use docker commit only for quick experiments. For repeatable builds, always use a Dockerfile.

Add metadata:


docker commit \
  --author="Shaikh Ahsan" \
  --message="Added curl" \
  abc123 \
  my-custom-ubuntu:v2

🧪 Hands-On Tips

Practice modifying containers.

Transition your changes into a Dockerfile later.

📚 Docker Terminology 

Understanding Docker terminology is essential for mastering containerization. Here’s a comprehensive list:

1. Docker Image

A read-only template used to create containers.

Contains everything needed to run an app: code, runtime, libraries.


2. Docker Container

A runnable instance of a Docker image.

Isolated and lightweight.


3. Dockerfile

A text file with instructions to build a Docker image.

Example:


FROM ubuntu
RUN apt update && apt install -y nginx

4. Docker Engine

The core Docker runtime responsible for building and running containers.


5. Docker Hub

A cloud-based registry for storing and sharing Docker images.

Public and private repositories available.


6. Volumes

Used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.

Useful for databases, configs, logs.


7. Layers

Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer.

Layers are stacked to form an image.


8. Tag

Used to version Docker images.

Default is latest.

Example: nginx:1.21


9. Repository

A collection of related images (with different tags).

Stored on Docker Hub or other registries.


10. Registry

A server where Docker images are stored and retrieved.

Example: Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, AWS ECR.


11. Docker Compose

A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Uses docker-compose.yml file.


12. Base Image

The starting point for building Docker images.

Example: ubuntu, alpine, node


13. Entrypoint & CMD

Define what runs when the container starts.


ENTRYPOINT ["nginx"]
CMD ["-g", "daemon off;"]

14. Build Context

The files available to the Docker engine when building an image.

Typically the directory where the Dockerfile resides.


15. Expose vs Publish Port

EXPOSE in Dockerfile is documentation.

-p in CLI maps host port to container port.


docker run -p 8080:80 nginx

16. Docker Network

Docker provides default networks like bridge, host, and none.

You can create custom networks.


docker network create my-net

17. Docker Swarm

Docker’s native clustering solution for managing containerized apps across a cluster of machines.


18. Build Cache

Docker caches intermediate layers during build to speed up rebuilds.


19. Bind Mounts

Allows mounting a host directory into a container.


docker run -v $(pwd):/app my-image

20. Overlay File System

Docker uses OverlayFS for image and container layers.
